I am going to talk about the disk drives of computers and laptops. You think that it only has one purpose, and that is to put a cd in or movie and watch or listen to it.
It can do so much more. You can put blank cds in the disk drive and burn mp3 cds, movies, games, and even put pictures of some disk. There can be many useful functions for the disk drive.
My favorite i used to do is downloan and burn cds on limewire. Most kids these days dont know what that is.


the next operating process im going to talk about is memorey mangmanet. It is a functionalilty of an operating system which handles and manages primary memory.
It moves procceses back and fourth between the main memory and the disk execuation. It can also check how much memory is to be allocates oto proces it. 
It is very important to have memory mangment as it is the most important job is managing the cpu.


The last operating system i am going to talk about it security. We use our computers and laptops to manage our lives, Bank accounts, emails, communication and we have to keep our 
information secure and out of the reach of other people. There are alot of bad people out there that look to prey on people with lack of knoledge and unfortunitly thats world wide
but credit card fraud and virtual fraud is very high risk situation. many people i know dont pay for extra security on their computer and ive been going back and fourth with if i shoulf
pay for some on mine or not. You can break through people fire walls and re route your IP address if your an attacker so you should make your self knoledgable on how to protect your infomation.
