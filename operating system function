I am going to talk about the disk drives of computers and laptops. You think that it only has one purpose, and that is to put a cd in or movie and watch or listen to it.
It can do so much more. You can put blank cds in the disk drive and burn mp3 cds, movies, games, and even put pictures of some disk. There can be many useful functions for the disk drive.
My favorite i used to do is downloan and burn cds on limewire. Most kids these days dont know what that is.
